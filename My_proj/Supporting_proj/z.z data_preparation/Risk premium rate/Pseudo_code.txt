Bascially we are having 3 approaches toward Risk free rate, which are:
    1, Use directly the latest VND gov bond
    2, Use the 3-month USD treasury bond (not comply with the currency and the time horizon)_ NOT USING CUZ IT DIFFERENT CURRENCY AND TIME HORIZON
    3, Use (1) but with the discount given in the look table for professor Aswath of NYU (the rate estimate by (3) can be go below into the negative region)_ NOT USING CUZ IT DONT MAKE SENSE

Next we have to find some data toward different approaches related to equity risk premium including:
    1, For forward approach
        + Indirect method 
            (1) Default spread on top of (1)
                * Ajusted for risk:
                    <*> Standard deviation in stock (utilized current cafef bot)
                    <*> Standard deviation in bonds (write new bot to scrap data from investing.com)
            (2) Directly use the equity premium given in the table of prof Aswath
        + Directly calculation:
            * Data on GOV (1-year back) -> investing.com bot
            * Data on Equity mkt (1-year back) -> cafef bot
            * Data on growth expectation of Equity mkt (5 years ahead) ???
    2, For backward approach (Not favourable)
        + Data on GOV bond
        + Data on equity market (as far as posible)
        + Run statical examination on data to get the equity risk premium

To scale over to company equity risk premium:
    Revenue break down by country data.
