For create a working stream between local python script and express API. We can consider either
    * Inter-process communication (IPC)
    * In-memory Data stores
Both approach have the low latency characteristic that suitable for real-time application.

The main different is IPC is a local approach that the scalability is depend on the local capactiy. Whilel In-memory is highly scalable 

For personal project, we will take in-line memory approach
